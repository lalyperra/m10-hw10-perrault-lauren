Issues: I still cannot get my transpiling to work.  I emailed Blakeley to arrange for one-on-one time later this week.
Also not sure how to get the actual number to show up. I tried using the $() that was shown in our videos for week 10 but that didn't seem to work. I'm hoping it's my ES6 that will fix it when I can get those files to work.
